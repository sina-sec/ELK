## Logstash Introduction
Logstash is an open source data collection engine with real-time pipelining capabilities.
Logstash can dynamically unify data from disparate sources and normalize the data into destinations of your choice.
Cleanse and democratize all your data for diverse advanced downstream analytics and visualization use cases.
While Logstash originally drove innovation in log collection, its capabilities extend well beyond that use case.
Any type of event can be enriched and transformed with a broad array of input, filter, and output plugins, with many native codecs further simplifying the ingestion process.
Logstash accelerates your insights by harnessing a greater volume and variety of data.

## Getting Started with Logstash
This section guides you through the process of installing Logstash and verifying that everything is running properly.
After learning how to stash your first event, you go on to create a more advanced pipeline that takes Apache web logs as input, parses the logs, and writes the parsed data to an Elasticsearch cluster.
Then you learn how to stitch together multiple input and output plugins to unify data from a variety of disparate sources.
